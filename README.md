## Quick Setup Guide

1. Add the submodule in your `admin/widgets` directory:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/dinosoeren/decap-ai-chat-widget.git static/admin/widgets/ai-chat/
```

2. Add the script, style, and dependencies to your `admin/index.html`:

```html
<!-- Content Assistant - AI Chat Widget -->
<script type="module" src="widgets/ai-chat/index.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="widgets/ai-chat/css/main.css" />
<!-- Crypto functions to encrypt/decrypt API keys. -->

      # ... other fields ...
      - { label: 'AI Chat', name: 'ai_chat', widget: 'ai-chat', required: false }

## API Keys

API keys never leave your device. They are encrypted before being cached locally in your browser.

- **Anthropic**: Get your API key from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)
- **Gemini**: Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
- **OpenAI**: Get your API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- **OpenRouter**: Get your API key from [OpenRouter Settings](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys)

![Click the robot icon to enter an API key for any model provider](./img/api-key.jpg)

> **Note**: Never commit API keys to version control.

## Caching

The widget implements intelligent caching to improve performance and reduce API calls.

- **Post & Repository Cache**: Post lists, post content, repository lists, and file contents are cached for **24 hours**.
- **Chat Cache**:
  - The active conversation is saved automatically as you chat.
  - Past conversations are stored in the **History** dropdown, scoped to the post you are currently editing.
- **Settings Cache**: Your selected model, meta prompt, and code selection settings are cached indefinitely.
- **Cache Clearing**: Use the "Refresh Posts" and "Refresh Repositories" buttons to manually clear the relevant cache and fetch fresh data. The "Erase Chat" and "Erase All History" buttons manage the chat conversation cache.

## GitHub API Limits

The widget uses the GitHub API to fetch repositories and file content. Unauthenticated requests are limited to 60 requests per hour.

API responses are cached locally in your browser for 24-hours to help mitigate these limits. For higher limits (up to 5000 requests per hour) and access to your private repositories, use a GitHub personal access token.

## Troubleshooting

- **Rate limit errors**: Wait an hour or use cached data.
- **User not found**: Check the GitHub username spelling.
- **Repository not found**: Ensure the repository exists and is public.
- **File loading errors**: Check if the file is accessible via GitHub's raw URLs. Very large files may cause performance issues.
